# Profile Picture & To-Do List Web App

This is a simple web application that allows users to upload a profile picture, enter their name, and maintain a basic to-do list. The profile picture and name are stored locally using the browser's `localStorage` API, allowing persistence across browser sessions.

## Demo

You can try out the application by cloning the repository and running the project locally.

## Features

- Profile Picture Upload: Users can upload a profile picture, which will be stored in the browser's localStorage.
- Persistent Name Input: The user's name is saved in localStorage and remains on page reload.
- Basic To-Do List: Users can add, view, and clear tasks in a simple to-do list format.
- LocalStorage Persistence: Both the profile picture and name persist even after the page is reloaded or closed.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5: For structuring the web page.
- CSS3: For styling the UI.
- JavaScript (ES6): To handle dynamic behavior and local storage management.
- LocalStorage API: To persist user data across browser sessions.
